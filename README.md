## What is it?

This repository is aimed at tracking my learning process and providing notes/scripts to the [Oracle's Tutorial on
Java Concurrency](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/index.html).
The tutorial covers an extensive number of concurrency-related topics such as Thread objects, 
synchronization, liveliness, and high-level concurrency API.
