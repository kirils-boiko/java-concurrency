/* There are two ways of using the Thread objects to create a concurrent application:
    - directly controlling the thread creation and management by simply instantiating
        Threads each time the application requires a concurrent application;
    - abstracting thread management using an executor.

    This project focuses on the direct use of Thread objects.
    For the use of executors, see HighLevelConcurrency project.
